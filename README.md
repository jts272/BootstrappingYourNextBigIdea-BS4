# Bootstrap Your Next Big Idea with Bootstrap 4

This repo contains the Bootstrap 4 solution code for the _Bootstrap Your Next Big Idea_ lesson

## What is covered

Bootstrap is an open-source CSS and JavaScript framework, that was developed by Twitter. It provides a huge library of components and functionality that we can you to make our websites responsive, as well as providing pre-built components like tables, buttons, forms, progress bars, etc. that are already styled and ready for us to use!

Throughout these lessons, we'll learn about how to develop responsive websites using Bootstrap's responsive grid, use different components like tables, and we'll put together a sample website using the Bootstrap framework

## What this repo is used for

I had started the Bootstrap 4 tutorial in a GitHub codespace.

I have configured a local install of VS Code for future iterations to this repo as I follow along with the CI tutorial.

After installing VS Code, further installs were made for:

- git
- node.js
- python

Relevant extensions were downloaded in VS Code, along with personal settings adjustments.

I have played around with the setup and version control in a test repo. I experimented with my configuration and followed the official VS Code video docs. I explored new concepts like the use of branches and version control from the GUI.

Further edits will be made in this forked repository.
